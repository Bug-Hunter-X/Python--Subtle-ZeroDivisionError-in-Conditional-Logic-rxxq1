# Python: Subtle ZeroDivisionError in Conditional Logic
This repository demonstrates a common coding error in Python related to zero-division handling, where a seemingly simple function fails when both input parameters are zero.

The file `bug.py` contains the code with the bug, illustrating how the `ZeroDivisionError` is raised. `bugSolution.py` presents the corrected version of the code with proper zero-division handling.  The solution uses explicit checks for both inputs to prevent any division-by-zero error.
